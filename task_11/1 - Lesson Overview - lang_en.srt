00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,734
Welcome to the first case study and intro to the data analysis.

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:08,099
In this lesson, you'll go through the entire data analysis process to analyze

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
a dataset on the chemical properties of wines and their associated quality readings.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,884
You'll also learn how to work with data using pandas,

5
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,879
Numpy and Matplotlib.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,699
Data often requires a significant amount of work

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,384
to make it suitable for analysis like cleaning,

8
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:25,440
feature engineering and visualizing,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,440
and these packages help make that work faster and more

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,320
efficient than standard python. Let's begin.
