1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,134
In order to get the append statement to work correctly,

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:05,744
we need to rename the column in red_df,

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,655
so that it matches the column name in the white_df.

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:11,279
To rename our columns in the previous lesson,

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,149
we set df.columns to a new list.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,115
Right now, we just need to change one of the column labels.

7
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:19,559
If we try to do that by setting one value of

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,954
df.columns by indexing it like this, we get an error.

9
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:27,209
Index does not support mutable operations.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,410
This just means, that this column label array is something we can't modify.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,000
And since we can't modify it,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,460
we'd have to reassign the whole thing to a new list like this.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,289
Although this worked, this seems like a lot of work to change just one column name.

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,579
We could do this better by using a method called rename.

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,960
Look at the Stack Overflow page and try renaming

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
the columns with this method in the Jupyter notebook in the next section.
