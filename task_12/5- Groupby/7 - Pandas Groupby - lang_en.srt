00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Group By is one of my favorite functions in pandas.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,060
It let's you group your data and aggregate information about

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,570
those groups or perform group specific transformations.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,390
In this section, we'll focus on using GroupBy to

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,890
get summary statistics about different groups in our data.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,810
Let's open the combined wine quality data frame we just created.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,280
Previously, we learn that we can get summary statistics

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,260
on the whole dataset with functions like describe or mean.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,859
From this, I can find information like the mean pH for all the samples in the data set.

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,204
But, what if I wanted to find the mean for each quality rating?

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:42,189
For example, the mean pH level for all samples of the quality rating of seven.

12
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:47,479
We could use groupby combined with the mean function to do this.

13
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,109
With this, we can find the mean pH level for

14
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,009
all samples with a quality rating of seven here.

15
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,424
We could even split the dataset with multiple columns to groupby,

16
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:02,709
by providing a list.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,155
These are means of all of the other features grouped by quality and then color.

18
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:10,060
Here, we see separate means for the pH level of

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,465
all the red and white samples with a quality of seven.

20
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:16,810
If you don't want quality or color to be made as the index,

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,400
you could set as_index to false.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,535
If you're only interested in one of the columns,

23
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:26,254
like the pH, you could index the groups like this.

24
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,539
Next, you'll learn groupby to draw some conclusions about this dataset.
