1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,125
Although, this visual shows us that

2
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,679
the white wine samples has slightly higher average quality ratings,

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,870
it would be nice if we could get more details on where that's coming from.

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,594
Let's put a more detailed bar chart,

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,280
counts for each quality rating by color.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,649
We can groupby quality and color to do this.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,009
Because these are counts,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,600
the values for all the columns will be the same.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,340
So we'll just pick an arbitrary one.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:35,820
That's close, but there are several things that can improve at this plot.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,939
First, there's clearly more white samples than red samples.

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,414
So it's hard to make a fair comparison, we just count.

13
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:42,615
To balance this out,

14
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:48,135
let's divide each count by the total count for that color to use proportions instead.

15
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,924
That looks a lot better.

16
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,684
We can see that for the lower ratings: three, four and five,

17
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,775
red samples show higher proportions,

18
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,579
and for the higher ratings: six, seven,

19
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,829
eight and nine, white samples have higher proportions.

20
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,314
The data we're showing looks great,

21
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,054
but the tick labels on the X axis look messy,

22
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:09,425
and it would be nicer to have the red and white bar for each rating next to each other.

23
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:13,159
We're also missing a spot for the red samples with a quality rating of nine.

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,685
Although that number is zero,

25
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,674
that spot should still be there.

26
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:19,448
Since there seems to be a lot of customization needed,

27
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:22,939
it would make more sense to plot directly on Matplotlib than with pandas.

28
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,000
Before we move on, let's learn more about Matplotlib.
